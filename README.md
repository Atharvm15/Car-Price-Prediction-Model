## Cell 1: Importing Necessary Libraries

In this cell, we import the required libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning regression analysis. Let's delve deeper into the purpose and functionality of each library:

- **pandas**: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It provides data structures like DataFrame and Series, which allow for easy handling of structured data. With pandas, users can perform operations such as reading and writing data from various formats, cleaning and preprocessing data, and conducting exploratory data analysis.

- **matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It offers a wide range of plotting functions to visualize data effectively, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and more. Matplotlib provides fine-grained control over the appearance of plots, making it suitable for creating publication-quality figures.

- **seaborn**: Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. It simplifies the process of creating complex visualizations by providing intuitive functions for common statistical plots like scatter plots, box plots, violin plots, and heatmaps. Seaborn also offers themes and color palettes to enhance the aesthetics of plots.

- **scikit-learn (sklearn)**: Scikit-learn is a comprehensive machine learning library that provides tools for data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and more. In this documentation, we specifically import modules for regression analysis:

    - `train_test_split`: This function splits data into training and testing sets, which is essential for assessing the performance of machine learning models.
    
    - `LinearRegression`: Linear regression is a simple and widely used regression technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.
    
    - `Lasso`: Lasso regression is a variant of linear regression that incorporates L1 regularization, which penalizes the absolute size of the coefficients. Lasso regression can be useful for feature selection and handling multicollinearity.
    
    - `metrics`: The metrics module provides various metrics to evaluate the performance of machine learning models, such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, R-squared, and others. These metrics help assess the accuracy and generalization ability of regression models.

In the subsequent cells, we will use these libraries for data analysis, visualization, model training, and evaluation in the context of regression analysis.

## Cell 2: Loading of Data
This line of code reads the diabetes dataset from a CSV file named 'car data.csv' and stores it in a pandas DataFrame named 'car_dataset'. 

Pandas' `read_csv()` function is used to read the contents of the CSV file into a DataFrame. This function automatically detects the delimiter used in the file (usually a comma) and parses the data into rows and columns. The resulting DataFrame allows for easy manipulation and analysis of the dataset, making it a popular choice for working with structured data in Python.


## Cell 3: DataFrame Inspection

In this cell, we inspect the DataFrame to gain insights into its structure, contents, and any missing values.

### Purpose

The purpose of this step is to understand the dataset by examining its first few rows, dimensions, data types, and missing values. This initial inspection helps in identifying potential issues, such as missing or inconsistent data, and guides subsequent data preprocessing steps.

### Usage

Several methods are used to inspect the DataFrame:

1. **`car_dataset.head()`**: Displays the first 5 rows of the DataFrame, providing a glimpse of the data's structure and content.

2. **`car_dataset.shape`**: Returns a tuple representing the dimensions of the DataFrame (number of rows, number of columns), allowing us to understand its size.

3. **`car_dataset.info()`**: Provides a concise summary of the DataFrame, including the data types of each column and the total number of non-null values. This method is useful for identifying the data types and detecting missing values.

4. **`car_dataset.isnull().sum()`**: Computes the number of missing values for each column in the DataFrame. This helps in identifying columns with missing data, which may require handling before further analysis.

## Cell 4: Categorical Data Distribution

In this cell, we analyze the distribution of categorical data within the dataset.

### Purpose

The purpose of this step is to understand the distribution of categorical variables such as Fuel_Type, Seller_Type, and Transmission. By examining the frequency counts of each category, we gain insights into the prevalence of different categories within these variables.

### Usage

To check the distribution of categorical data, we use the following commands:

1. **`car_dataset.Fuel_Type.value_counts()`**: Prints the frequency counts of each category in the Fuel_Type column, revealing the distribution of fuel types among the cars in the dataset.

2. **`car_dataset.Seller_Type.value_counts()`**: Prints the frequency counts of each category in the Seller_Type column, showing the distribution of seller types (Dealer or Individual) in the dataset.

3. **`car_dataset.Transmission.value_counts()`**: Prints the frequency counts of each category in the Transmission column, indicating the distribution of transmission types (Manual or Automatic) among the cars.

## Cell 5: Data Preparation and Splitting

In this cell, we prepare the dataset for modeling by splitting it into features (X) and target variable (Y), and then further splitting it into training and testing sets.

### Purpose

The purpose of this step is to divide the dataset into independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target) for building a predictive model. Additionally, we split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

### Usage

To prepare the dataset and split it into features and target variable, follow these steps:

1. **Drop Columns**: Remove unnecessary columns like 'Car_Name' and 'Selling_Price' from the dataset to create the feature set (X) using `car_dataset.drop(['Car_Name','Selling_Price'],axis=1)`.

2. **Assign Target Variable**: Extract the target variable 'Selling_Price' and assign it to Y using `car_dataset['Selling_Price']`.

3. **Print Features and Target**: Print the feature set (X) and target variable (Y) using `print(X)` and `print(Y)` respectively, to verify the data.

4. **Split Dataset**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()` function from scikit-learn, specifying the test size and random state.


## Cell 6: Model Training and Evaluation

In this cell, we load the linear regression model, train it on the training data, and evaluate its performance using R-squared error. We also visualize the model's predictions compared to the actual prices.

### Purpose

The purpose of this step is to train the linear regression model on the training data, evaluate its performance using R-squared error, and visualize the model's predictions against the actual prices to assess its accuracy and generalization ability.

### Usage

To train and evaluate the linear regression model, follow these steps:

1. **Load Model**: Instantiate the Linear Regression model using `LinearRegression()`.

2. **Train Model**: Fit the model to the training data using `lin_reg_model.fit(X_train,Y_train)`.

3. **Prediction on Training Data**: Make predictions on the training data using `lin_reg_model.predict(X_train)` to assess how well the model fits the training data.

4. **R-squared Error**: Compute the R-squared error between the actual and predicted values using `metrics.r2_score(Y_train, training_data_prediction)`. This metric quantifies the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

5. **Visualization**: Visualize the actual prices versus the predicted prices on both training and testing data using scatter plots to visualize the model's performance.

6. **Repeat for Lasso Regression**: Repeat the above steps for Lasso Regression by loading the model, training it, making predictions, evaluating R-squared error, and visualizing the results.
